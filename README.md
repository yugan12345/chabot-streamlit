## üß± How It Works

1. **Data Collection:**  
   Using **Selenium** to scrape relevant pages from the web.

2. **Text Cleaning & Processing:**  
   Extract raw text using BeautifulSoup, then chunk and embed it.

3. **Indexing with FAISS:**  
   Text chunks are converted into embeddings and stored in a FAISS index.

4. **RAG Pipeline:**  
   On each query, relevant documents are retrieved and passed to the language model for generating answers.
